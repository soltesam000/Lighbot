### Lightbot
# Lightbot is a very easy game where you dont have to put much effort in until you get to the higher levels. This game gets addictive after a while though.The robot has to be programmed to light up all the blue tiles by you making it turn or jump or walk forward. This little robot follows all the commands you give it. Lighbot helps understand programming it also motivates you to keep walking forward. 

### Robo Mind
# After playing Robo Mind, i've realized that it is very similar to Light bot. Both robots are programmed for a certain purpose. In lightbot, you have to light up the tiles, while in robo mind you have different commands like "paint the tiles white" or "pick up the box" make an M or make an A with black paint. Both of these games helped me understand how to program and it gives me an idea of what this class will be about.
